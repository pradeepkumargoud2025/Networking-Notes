# OSPF LSA Types

OSPF routers exchange **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)** to build the LSDB. Each LSA type has a specific purpose.

## LSA Type 1 – Router LSA
- Generated by every router within an area.
- Describes router links, link states, and metrics.
- Flooded **only within the same area**.

## LSA Type 2 – Network LSA
- Generated by the Designated Router (DR) on a broadcast or NBMA network.
- Describes all routers attached to that network.
- Flooded **only within the area**.

## LSA Type 3 – Summary LSA
- Generated by ABR (Area Border Router).
- Summarizes networks from one area to advertise into another.
- Used to reduce LSDB size and contain flooding.

## LSA Type 4 – Summary ASBR LSA
- Generated by ABR to advertise the location of an ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) into other areas.
- Helps internal routers know how to reach external routes.

## LSA Type 5 – AS External LSA
- Generated by ASBR.
- Advertises external routes (from other AS or redistributed routes).
- Flooded **throughout the OSPF AS** (except stub areas).

## LSA Type 7 – NSSA External LSA
- Used in NSSA areas.
- Allows external routes within NSSA.
- Converted to Type 5 by ABR when entering backbone.

### Key Points:
- Each router maintains a **complete LSDB** for its area.
- LSA flooding ensures consistent routing information for SPF calculations.
