# Network Design

The objective of network design is to satisfy data communication requirements and achieve efficient overall performance.

## 1. Network Segmentation
Involves controlling traffic among networked devices. Complete or physical network segmentation occurs when a network is isolated from all others.

## 2. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
A network area designed to be accessed by outside visitors but still isolated from the private network of the organization. The DMZ is often used to host public-facing services such as web servers.

## 3. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
Created by switches to logically segment a network without altering its physical topology.

## 4. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A communication tunnel that provides point-to-point transmission of both authentication and data traffic over an untrusted network.

## 5. Defense in Depth
Uses multiple types of access controls in literal or theoretical layers to help an organization avoid a monolithic security stance.

## 6. NAC (Network Access Control)
A concept of controlling access to an environment through strict adherence to and implementation of security policies.
